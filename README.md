CymaSonics Modular II

(c) 2010 - 2014 stefan.berke @ modular-audio-graphics.com

This is an attempt to rewrite the infamous CymaSonics Modular Editor in the Qt framework.

Just started on this. 
It has no real functionallity right now, but Modules can be displayed and edited already. 

Check the dev branch for recent changes.

If all goes well, this will be the perfect modular audio (and probably video) system for programmers. It's planned to build in a C++ compile chain to compile dynamics libs on the fly for use as Module.
